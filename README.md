# school-attendance-zone-visualization

This is the program to view the output data from the school-attendance-zones project (https://github.com/louisgarder/school-atendance-zones). Each school attendance zone 
that is created in the school-attendance-zones project is displayed in this program by plotting the longitude and latitude of the centers of population of each group block
in the attendance zones (view https://github.com/louisgarder/school-atendance-zones for more information). 

To run this program, two variables in the mainwindown.cpp file have to be initialized to the proper values by the user.
'inputFile' should be set equal to the path/name of the output file of the school-attendance-zones project. 'configuration' should be set equal to the specific conifiguration
from the inputFile that should be displayed. 

This project was created and is maintained by Raymond Suo. For more information, please email rms7988@gmail.com
